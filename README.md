# Javascript Exercise - This Dot

### @author Sruti Cheedalla

This is a javascript coding exercise for This Dot. It can search github users and display the users in a paginated format. This exercise is written in Vue.js. I am relatively new to Vue so I wanted to challenge myself to write this exercise in a new framework.
